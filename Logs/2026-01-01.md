## 📝 The After-Action Report
*To be completed at the end of the day.*

Today, I finished implementing the "Everform" movement on the phone, then I managed to add a game pause button, PlayAgain button, Continue, and more. It was a long session, but very productive best way to start the new year! Things didn't go as planned for my diet. I couldn't get the Whey protein today, it will come in 3 days, and I had to increase the fish portion.

### 🚫 Habit Resistance
*Did I face any triggers (smoking/junk food)? How did I beat them?*

I didn't struggle a lot resisting anything today. The suffering will start from day 2-3, probably. I only felt a little bit hungry after the gym today, and I used to buy snacks directly after the gym, but since I have a very specific diet planned, I resisted that cue.

### ⭐ The Small Win
*One specific thing I am proud of today:*

I deleted "WWM", I just can't control myself when I play something that I like. And this game is amazing in a way I can't resist. So, I had to delete it to be able to focus on my personal growth.
