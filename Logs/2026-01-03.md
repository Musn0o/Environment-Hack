## 📝 The After-Action Report
*To be completed at the end of the day.*

Today things didn't go as planned for the project and study. After coming back from the gym I started with the optional project first and I got stuck with it for a while. When I finished and went to working on the design for "Everform" I froze, and I couldn't create anything. After all I didn't use Blender for 2 years, and I wasn't very experience with it. I will need time to get used to it again. So, I decided that I will work on creating the character creation Scene in a very simple low looking until I can create something worth looking at with Blender.


### 🚫 Habit Resistance
*Did I face any triggers (smoking/junk food)? How did I beat them?*

I can't count how many things I resisted today xD. It was a very tough day, starting from last night. I woke up to drink some water, and I felt dizzy and weak. I doubt it's withdrawal symptoms, maybe because I stopped using sugar or smoking, but I feel it's 80% sugar. Usually, smoking withdrawal symptoms are headaches and anger.

### ⭐ The Small Win
*One specific thing I am proud of today:*

Yesterday, I cooked only fish. Today, I also cooked rice. Tomorrow I will make something even better!
