## 📝 The After-Action Report
*To be completed at the end of the day.*

I woke up today feeling that I wanna eat something, I wasn't hungry, but I felt I wanna eat. I ignored that feeling, and went to workout, but it stayed with during the workout till 11 AM maybe. If I didn't get myself busy on the project probably I could fall for this feeling and ate, I will try to keep myself busy as long as I can. I also got email saying *"Your account has been approved, and your app is now live on the ironSource Ads network."* it's for my application "Achtung" I didn't work on it for a while I had an update on hold because of the ad implementation maybe I've to work on it tomorrow, but I need to design with Blender for "Everform" too. It seems along day waiting for me tomorrow.

### 🚫 Habit Resistance
*Did I face any triggers (smoking/junk food)? How did I beat them?*

Today is Friday, and I'm used to going to the cafe and smoking hookah after the gym. I was afraid of walking beside the cafe and seeing everyone smoking over there that would trigger the cue, but I didn't take money before going to the gym to protect myself from the cue.

### ⭐ The Small Win
*One specific thing I am proud of today:*

I cooked the fish by myself, and I will no longer have to order delivery or wait for someone to make food for me.
