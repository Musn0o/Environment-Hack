## 📜 Rules of the Game
* **The Green Square Rule:** Every commit must represent real progress (a new German phrase, a bug fix, or a health log).
* **The "Never Miss Twice" Rule:** If life happens and a day is missed, the next day is non-negotiable.
* **The Environment Shield:** This repo is a space where local "norms" don't exist. Only my goals matter here.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `/German`: Vocabulary lists and grammar notes.
* `/Logs`: Detailed daily reflections (optional).
* `/Projects`: Code snippets or documentation for what I'm building.
